Description: 
  The somTools package provides familiar and novel visualizations and
  analyses of Kohonen's self-organizing map. Supports maps created by 
  the 'som' and 'kohonen' packages.
  Developed at the University of Rhode Island, USA.
  .
  Includes a novel visualization of the self-organizing map where training
  or new data are mapped to the nodes of the map, adjusting their position
  to take into account similarity to neighboring nodes. The plotted area of
  individual nodes may be adjusted according to a cartogram function, perhaps
  to increase the size of areas with high data density.
  .
  There exist in R multiple implementations of Kohonen's self-
  organizing maps. To facilitate further development of tools for working
  with SOMs, this package provides a common interface. When a somCart is
  created from some other type of SOM, the original SOM's properties will
  be converted (if necessary) and copied to the slots of the somCart.
  .
  This package does not itself create SOMs. Supported SOM implementations
  include those in the packages som and kohonen.
